A staging package to demonstrate various custom R functions. Part R packages maintained by Brandon Rose's "Rosyverse" and some functions used in other packages like RosyREDCap

## Installation

You can install the development version of RosyUtils like so:

``` r
# install remotes package if you don't have it
# install.packages("remotes") 
remotes::install_github("brandonerose/RosyUtils")
```

If you have any issues above download the most recent version of R at RStudtio and update all packages in RStudio. See [thecodingdocs.com/r/getting-started](https://www.thecodingdocs.com/r/getting-started "R Getting Started").

## Microsoft Outlook Clean Up Example

The following uses the [Microsoft365R](https://github.com/Azure/Microsoft365R "Microsoft365R") package from Microsoft Azure. RosyUtils leverages this package to automate simple deletion of emails from certain email addresses in bulk!
```{r , eval=FALSE}

library("Microsoft365R") #install.packages("Microsoft365R")
library("RosyUtils") # remotes::install_github("brandonerose/RosyUtils")

# outlook <- get_personal_outlook() 
outlook <- get_business_outlook() # this will open authenticator in Microsoft to allow Microsoft365R to use the graph API. May have to run several times at first.

inbox <- outlook$get_inbox()

# the following function will sample the first 1,000 (n) emails from your inbox
# then it will sort all the from addresses and count how many emails there are
# It will print all of the sampled subject lines from this email to aid your choice
# It will ask if you want to delete anything from this email. 1 for Yes and 2 for No
# then it will search for ALL emails in your inbox from this
# again will show subject but this time for all
# final choice for deleting
# if you choose yes it will print message as it deletes
# you can stop anytime with escape button!
# you have the option to change to full_address = F which will use the root email
# for example searching by from med.miami.edu instead email@med.miami.edu
choose_emails_to_delete_in_bulk(inbox, full_address = T, n = 1000)

```

## Future plans

* Future versions will demonstrate more advanced features already included!
* Documentation needs to be updated
* Need to add vignettes
* Open to collaboration/feedback
